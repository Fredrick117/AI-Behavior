## Game AI Behavior Simulation
Made with openFrameworks

## Background
This simulation was made to illustrate a few of the different movement types behind modern game AI. For example:
- Seek (a boid moves towards the target location, but does not stop when it reaches the location)
- Arrive (a boid moves towards the target location, slowing its velocity as it approaches the destination and eventually stopping)
- Wander (a boid moves around the world in a random fashion)
- Flock (a group of boids move together, like a flock of birds)
